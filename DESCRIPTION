Description: Fits multivariate (Brownian Motion, Early Burst, ACDC, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Shifts) models of continuous traits evolution on trees and time series. 'mvMORPH' also proposes high-dimensional multivariate comparative tools (linear models using Generalized Least Squares and multivariate tests) based on penalized likelihood.  See
