Title: Multivariate Comparative Tools for Fitting Evolutionary Models to Morphometric Data
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2018-07-31
Author: Julien Clavel, with contributions from Aaron King, and Emmanuel Paradis
Maintainer: Julien Clavel <julien.clavel@hotmail.fr>
Description: Fits multivariate (Brownian Motion, Early Burst, ACDC, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Shifts) models of continuous traits evolution on trees and time series. 'mvMORPH' also proposes high-dimensional multivariate comparative tools (linear models using Generalized Least Squares) based on penalized likelihood.  See
